# Stino
### New Version (Dev Version)

Stino is a [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) plugin, which provides an [Arduino](http://arduino.cc)-like environement for editing, compiling and uploading sketches. The plugin was written by Robot Will in 2012-2014. If you have any idea or suggestion, leave messages to me. Thanks.

**NOTE:** This project will be updated by all who want to collaborate with it, Robot Will seems to have not time to maintain the plugin updated.


## Requirements
#### 1. [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com)

#### 2. [Arduino](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)


## Documents
Currently there is no complete documents for this plugin, and I am working on this plugin and will wirte documents in the following days. But you can find some documets in [issues](https://github.com/Robot-Will/Stino/issues). I need your help to write documents.


## Installation
While the plugin keeps as a beta, the installation process will be:


1. You should first delete whatever version you have installed currently.
2. Open the Command Palette and choose the `'Package Control: Add Repository'` command.
3. Copy this repo link `https://github.com/Robot-Will/Stino/tree/new-stino` and paste into the prompt.
4. Open the Command Palette again and run the `'Package Control: Install Package'` command and choose the package named `'Stino'`. Be sure you don't choose the package in the default repository called `'Arduino-Like IDE.'`
