### New Version (Dev Version)

Stino is a [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) plugin, which provides an [Arduino](http://arduino.cc)-like environement for editing, compiling and uploading sketches. The plugin was written by Robot Will in 2012-2014.


## Requirements
#### 1. [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com)

#### 2. [Arduino](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)


## Installation
This version Stino can only be installed by manual installation. If you installed the previous version via Package Control, please remove or disable it firstly (see issue [#179](https://github.com/Robot-Will/Stino/issues/179)). Manual installation has only two steps:

1. Click menu `Preferences`->`Browse Packages...` to open the packages folder.

2. Download [zip file](https://github.com/Robot-Will/Stino/archive/new-stino.zip), extract the folder to the packages folder, rename it from `Stino-new-stino` to `Stino` and the Arduino menu appears.
