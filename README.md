# Stino

Stino is a [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) plugin that provides an [Arduino](http://arduino.cc)-like environement for editing, compiling and uploading sketches. The plugin was written by @Robot-Will in 2012-2014. If you have any ideas or suggestions, please leave me a message. Thanks.

**NOTE:** This project will be updated by all who want to collaborate on it. @Robot-Will seems to no longer have time to maintain the plugin any longer and this fork is currently the most recently maintained.


## Requirements

1. [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com)
2. [Arduino IDE](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)


## Documentation
Currently there is no documentation for this plugin. I'm working on the plugin and and plan to write some when I can. Until then, you can refer to the [issues](https://github.com/gepd/Stino/issues). I need your help writing some documentation.


## Installation

While the plugin is in beta, the installation process is:

1. You should first delete whatever version you currently have installed.
2. Open the Command Palette and choose the `'Package Control: Add Repository'` command.
3. Copy this repo link `https://github.com/gepd/Stino/tree/new-stino` and paste it into the prompt.
4. Open the Command Palette again and run the `'Package Control: Install Package'` command and choose the package named `'Stino'`. Be sure you don't choose the package in the default repository called `'Arduino-Like IDE.'`

Thank you to **@jggdotcom** for the instructions.
