# Stino

### New Version (Dev Version)

Stino is a [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) plugin, which provides an [Arduino](http://arduino.cc) environement for creating, editing, compiling and uploading sketches. The plugin was written by Robot Will in 2012-2014. If you have any ideas or suggestions, leave a message for me. Thanks.


## Requirements

1. [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com)
2. [Arduino](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)


## What it does

The plugin adds an Arduino dropdown menu to Sublime text from which you can access the IDE features:

### Manage Sketches

* New Sketch - Create a new sketch in your sketchbook. This will create a sketch folder in your default Arduino sketchbook folder and initialise it with an .ino file.
* Sketchbook - Open any project in your sketchbook folder and open the scetch directory in the Sublime sidebar.

### Verify / Compile / Upload

Verify, compile or upload a sketch directly to your Arduino. You will need to have chosen a serial port to activate these features.

### Serial port

Choose the USB port that your Arduino is plugged into. You will not be able to upload code until you have done this. You can also open the serial monitor as a file.

### Preferences

Change your sketchbook and build folders, and set various compilation options.
